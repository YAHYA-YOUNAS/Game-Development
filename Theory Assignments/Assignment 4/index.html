                            <li>Fremium</li>
                            <dd>We will use fremium business model for our game. In this model, we will use in-game purchases in which the player will have to pay in order to continue the game.</dd><br>
                            <dd>As there are three main levels in the game, i.e., to collect water, wind, and fire. After the basic understanding of game, the player will move to achieve goals in the game. The first element will be collected by the character free of cost. But in case, the energy boosts of characters are finished or used already, the player will have to pay to buy energy boosts for the survival of the character. </dd><br>
                            <dd>When the first element is collected, the game interface will notify the player to buy the other assets and continue the game. If player ignore the notification, the game will continue with limited features and the chance to complete the game will be minimum.</dd><br>
                            <dd>So, the player will pay for next levels because collection of the next two elements is mandatory in order to complete the game. This is the way, we setup our business model to earn from the game.</dd>
