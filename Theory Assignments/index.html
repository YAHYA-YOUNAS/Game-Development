                    <dt>2. Combat:</dt>
                    <dd>In this game, combat is simple. The player just pressed a button to shoot homing    bullets at nearby enemies. Fighting mostly meant being near enemy and spamming a button. Ori can also throw a giant energy lance. This is much slower than his bow, but it does a lot more damage. He can also throw a ball of light that explodes like a grenade. Not all of the abilities focus on combat. One can use up energy (the resource you need to use many of the moves) to restore health. Having all of these new tools make fights a lot more interesting.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>3. Physics:</dt>
                    <br>
                    <dd>Physics is the base of any game. Like other Metroid Vania games, a lot of physics materials will be used for the movement of characters, animations in the scenes, etc. Some of the major physics elements used in the game are: <br><br>
                        <ul type="circle">
                            <li>Colliders on character and surfaces of scenes for the movement of the character.</li>
                            <li>Colliders for the interaction between different characters.</li>
                            <li>Colliders for the collection of game objects by the character.</li>
                            <li>Mass and friction for the movement of the character.</li>
                            <li>And many more…</li>
                        </ul> <br><br>
                        The core mechanic in the game is when Ori bashes projectiles, lanterns, or enemies, pushing them to one direction and pushing themselves to the opposite direction. <br><br>
                        Apart from these mechanics-heavy interest curves, Ori also keeps its high level of interest through its gorgeous hand-painted worlds, orchestral music, and a deep story about love, growth, and sacrifice.

                    <dt>1. Story:</dt><br>
                    <dd>The forest of Nibel is dying, after a powerful storm sets a series of devastating events in motion. An unlikely hero must journey to find his courage and confront a dark nemesis to save his home. “The Spirit Tree” who has some magical powers that can again give life to the forest. But due to devastating events in the forest, The Spirit Tree’s magical powers becomes weaken and required three elements (Water, Wind, Fire) to restore these magical powers. The hero must collect all the required three elements i.e., Water, Wind &amp; fire and gives these elements to “The Spirit Tree”. After gaining all the magical powers, The Spirit Tree have to do a magic that recover the forest. Finally, the forest gains it greenery back and the hero secure his home as well as others forest species. </dd>
                    <dd>The story begins with the introductory video in which the situation of the forest before the storm and after the storm will discussed. After powerful storm, all the forest’s species lose their home/shelter. They effect badly due to this storm. They have no food to eat as all the forest is destroyed. All the species go to the “The Spirit Tree” and ask him to do a magic that gives life to the forest.  “The Spirit Tree” tell them that he needs three basic elements to do a magic Fire, Water, Wind elements. He also tells them that these elements are not to be found easily. Who want to reach to these elements will also face a lot of hurdles. And there is a high risk that he will never return, lose his life. So, All the species discuss to each other who will get all these elements?  Who is brave among us? At least, a specie named “Ori” comes forward and tell them that he will go and get all these three elements back and give them to “The Spirit Tree”. All species begin admiring of “Ori” braveness.
                    Now, the “Ori” starts its journey towards the first element “Wind”. He faces many hurdles while he is in his journey. He must collect energy booster while going toward the element. These boosters will refill his energy while fighting with dragon. Finally, he reached to the element “Wind”, but he has to fight with and kill the Wind dragon who are guarding this element. After killing the dragon, he starts his journey toward second element “Water” which is deep inside the ocean. He also faces the same hurdles and reach to the element, but he has to kill the second dragon who is guarding the element “Water”. After killing the Water dragon, he starts his journey toward third and last element “Fire” which is top of the mountain. He also faces the hurdles include fire storm, etc. and reach to the element but he has to kill the third dragon who is guarding the element “Fire”.
                    </dd>
                    <dd> Finally, after getting all these three elements he returns to “The Spirit Tree” and give him these elements. “The Spirit Tree” finally able to do magic and after doing so, the forest gain its greenery back and all the species again live a happy life. </dd>
