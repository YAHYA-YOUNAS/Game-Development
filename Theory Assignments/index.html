            <dl>
                <dt>1. Rules:</dt><br>
                <dd>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>The power of Ori reduces with time, so he need energy boost to survive.</li>
                        <li>Ori has to go through the combat against dragons to achieve living elements.</li>
                        <li>Ori has to acquire specific units of water, air, and fire.</li>
                        <li>The spiritual tree need living elements in order to revive the life of forest.</li>
                        <li>Ori has limited weapons to fight with dragons.</li>
                        <li>If weapons lost, Ori will have to fight with dragons only by hand.</li>
                    </ul>
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dt>2. Combat:</dt>
                <dd>In this game, combat is simple. The player just pressed a button to shoot homing    bullets at nearby enemies. Fighting mostly meant being near enemy and spamming a button. Ori can also throw a giant energy lance. This is much slower than his bow, but it does a lot more damage. He can also throw a ball of light that explodes like a grenade. Not all of the abilities focus on combat. One can use up energy (the resource you need to use many of the moves) to restore health. Having all of these new tools make fights a lot more interesting.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>3. Physics:</dt>
                <br>
                <dd>Physics is the base of any game. Like other Metroid Vania games, a lot of physics materials will be used for the movement of characters, animations in the scenes, etc. Some of the major physics elements used in the game are: <br><br>
                    <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Colliders on character and surfaces of scenes for the movement of the character.</li>
                        <li>Colliders for the interaction between different characters.</li>
                        <li>Colliders for the collection of game objects by the character.</li>
                        <li>Mass and friction for the movement of the character.</li>
                        <li>And many more…</li>
                    </ul> <br><br>
                    The core mechanic in the game is when Ori bashes projectiles, lanterns, or enemies, pushing them to one direction and pushing themselves to the opposite direction. <br><br>
                    Apart from these mechanics-heavy interest curves, Ori also keeps its high level of interest through its gorgeous hand-painted worlds, orchestral music, and a deep story about love, growth, and sacrifice.
